Our complex reality reveals itself as a limit for our compartmentalisation of knowledge,
that is why I believe we should increase communication between different fields of science.
Moreover, in an interdisciplinarity context, physics as a lot to offer.
This work is a personal exercise towards this philosophy.

\subsection*{Research Aim}

What is the impact on the transport of nitrates to non-motile phytoplankton cells (diatoms) in
the presence of chemotactic bacteria?

\subsection*{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantifying the impact of bacterial chemotaxis on the diatom's nutrient availability.
    \item Modelling the nutrient transport dynamics: Diffusion Equation with a Consumption term.
    \item Implementing a numerical solution for the model.
    \item Analytical results validating the numeric's.
    \item \color{red} Qualify which symbiotic relationship exists between bacterium and the diatom.  
\end{itemize}
