\subsection{Biological Background}

\subsubsection*{Overview of Phytoplankton and Their Role in Ecosystems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Role of phytoplankton in aquatic ecosystems (Contribution to the food chain, O2 production and CO2 absorption).
    \item Importance of Nitrate Nutrients (Phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake mechanisms, Emergence of competition due to nutrient limitation).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Bacterium: Competitors in Nutrient Uptake}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chemotaxis mechanisms (Foraging strategy for marine (and soil) microorganisms)
    \item Competition (Chemotactic bacteria are attracted to and consume nitrates, competing with diatoms for nutrient availability).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Interaction with Bacteria: Competition for Nitrates and Symbiosis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Diatoms secrete chemicals that attract bacteria.
    \item \color{red} Â¿Optimization of bacterial chemotaxis by diatoms?
\end{itemize}
