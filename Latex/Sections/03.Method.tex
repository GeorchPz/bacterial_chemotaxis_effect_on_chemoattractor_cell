% \subsection{Theoretical Framework: A Continuum Model}
\subsection{From Discreet to Continuum}

\subsubsection*{Chemotaxis at an Individual Level}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Discreet and stochastic model.
    \item Individual trajectory, \( x_j(t) \).
\end{itemize}\subsubsection*{Chemotaxis at a Population Level}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Transition from individual to population-level, discrete to continuum approaches.
    \item Continuum and deterministic model, diffusion equation with consumption.
    \item Concentration, \( c(t) \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Dimensionalisation}

We start from the physical equation, where we have capitalised its magnitudes:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial N(\vec{R}, T)}{\partial T} =
    D \, \nabla^2_{\vec{R}} \, N(\vec{R}, T)
    - \mathrm{A} \, N(\vec{R}, T) \,C(\vec{R}, T)
\label{eq:Diff_physical}
\end{equation}

These quantities represent the real, laboratory measures:
\(\vec{R}\) is the position vector relative to the diatom,
\(T\) is time,
\(D\) is the diffusion coefficient,
\(N\) \& \(C\) are the nutrient and bacterial concentration respectively, and
\(\mathrm{A}\) is the bacterial consumption rate.
Now, we introduce the following variables changes, to obtain a dimensionless equation:

\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \vec{R} = L \, \vec{r}, \
    T = \frac{L^2}{D} \, t, \quad
    N = \frac{n}{L^3}, \quad
    C = \frac{c}{L^3}, \quad
    \mathrm{A} = DL \, \alpha
\right\}
\label{eq:change_of_vars}
\end{equation}

Where the set of lowercase variables (like \(n\) or \(\alpha\)) are the dimensionless equivalent of the capitalised variables. 
Whereas \(L\) represents the characteristic length of the system (for example, the system's or diatom's size),
\(\frac{L^2}{D}\) is the time unit of the system, meaning the time it takes for a nutrient to diffuse through \(L\). 
Replacing these (\ref{eq:change_of_vars}) into the equation (\ref{eq:Diff_physical}),
we obtain the new equation (\ref{eq:Diff_non-dim}) which is ideal for numerical simulations.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial n (\vec{r}, t)}{\partial t} =
    \nabla^2_{\vec{r}} \, n (\vec{r}, t)
    - \alpha \, n(\vec{r}, t) \, c(\vec{r}, t)
\label{eq:Diff_non-dim}
\end{equation}
