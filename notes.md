- Bacterial Profiles $\Rightarrow$ Opposite Initial Condition

ODE boundaries are fixed on n(x=0), n(x=L) instead of their derivatives

- Diatom MidStep's & Exp's FluxMap

## Diff w/ Consump

#### 1. Solver1D
Generalise Analytical solution for different Bacterial Concentrations?

#### 2. Plotter
Is there a more pythonic way of writting the code?
- change x=0 to r=R
- add Analytical Flux
